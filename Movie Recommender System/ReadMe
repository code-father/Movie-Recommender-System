This project is about a Movie Recommender System that I built using the MovieLens 100K dataset.
Recommender systems are used to provide personalized ratings depending upon the user profile and/or profiles of similar users.
I’ve used collaborative filtering method to train this machine learning algorithm.
This algorithm predicts the rating of a movie the user would’ve given and then recommends the highest rated movies to the user.
The MovieLens 100K is used as dataset in our project. The MovieLens 100K dataset contains 100,000 ratings from 943 users on 1682 movies. 
Each user has more than 20 ratings. The ratings for each movie are from 1 to 5. The data was collected through the MovieLens web site.
